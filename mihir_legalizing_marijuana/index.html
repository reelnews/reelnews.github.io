      Marijuana. Cannabis. Pot. Weed. There are a handful of names that all mean the same thing: the drug that is produced from the cannabis flower. We have all heard about marijuana, but sadly, too many have been exposed to a substance that can be so devastating to our lives. Some people make a profit out of it, some people innocently use it to seek paradise without knowing the repercussions, and many have met unfortunate ends due to marijuana. With marijuana being able to significantly damage youth and with it easily being abused, the legalization of the drug should be deprecated.

      I know, I know, you might be one of those hip kids that think going for a few shots is mega groovy, but it is not. Even though former president Barack Obama has admitted to smoking pot as a kid, it is a decision that he regrets (Brownstein). I can admit, their marketing game is up to speed. They got all the tactics they need to sneak in some use of marijuana or smoking in general without the audience even noticing. You got the specialized ads targeted in the right mediums: movies, TV, video games, the Internet, and retail stores (CDC). In simple terms, marijuana is able to block an action of a natural neurotransmitter, and then the body starts relying on marijuana instead (Addiction Center). If the person suddenly stops using marijuana, then they will experience withdrawal symptoms. So now that you know what marijuana does, why would the youth even be affected? Well, only a meager 60.2% of adolescents have reported an opportunity to use illegal drugs (Swendsen). If there are already ⅗ of adolescents getting access to illegal drugs, making them legal will only increase the chance of people getting access to drugs, and people are smart enough to work around the system to get them while voiding the regulations. So after all this explanation, you still do not know one important detail. How many children will receive the damage from marijuana. Can you image two people in your class dying? Can you imagine two people in every class across the nation dying? One out of every thirteen children? In 2015, that would be about 5.6 million children (CDC).

      Even though marijuana can do such terrible things to so many people, marijuana can also be used to help people. Before I can talk about how marijuana can help, I will just need to talk a little bit more about the science, so hold on for just a little bit. There is a type of chemical that helps with “regulating pleasure, memory, thinking, concentration, body movement, awareness of time, appetite, pain, and the senses” (NIDA). These chemicals are called cannabinoids, and while the body does produce them naturally, there are ways to get them into your body from other sources, such as marijuana. For beneficial medical purposes, the two main cannabinoids from marijuana are THC and CBD (NIDA). THC is the one people are interested in for “recreational” purposes, as they make people high, while CBD doesn’t (NIDA). They both help with “reducing pain, inflammation, and muscle control” (NIDA). One of the biggest discoveries is that marijuana extracts can be used to kill cancer cells, or decrease their effect (NIDA). This opens a door to a realm of possibilities, and can void every reason to ban marijuana. It is amazing, but there is one major catch, and it is something that one person cannot control. Drugs and medications that relieve pain or cause the “high” feeling, can easily be abused, without anyone but the user knowing.

      Let’s get started with the numbers. In 2017, 76% of the public agrees that prescription drug abuse is “an extremely or very serious public health problem” (Oliphant). We can agree that marijuana is a drug, and if it becomes legal, doctors could prescribe it to patients. This would not be good if about ¾ of the citizens are saying that there is a high chance that marijuana can be abused. Opioids are another drug that can, and have been, prescribed. Sadly, many people have been taking advantage of the system to abuse the drug and extract heroin from it. There is an intricate system that is used for the illegal exploitation and there are so many different levels, so it is hard for the authorities to shut it down. Will the same events not occur if marijuana becomes legalized? It may cost more money to keep marijuana illegal, but wouldn’t it cost even more to shut down the operations going behind the scene that would be exploiting marijuana (Pappas).

      Hopefully, you can see by now that the legalization of marijuana is not going to be a wise choice for our society in its current state. But now that you know that, what are you going to do now with all this information? What you may not know is that you have a lot more power than you think. The 2020 presidential elections will be coming up soon. Voters, if they unite under common goals, can be a powerful force in this society, so take the correct action and choose a candidate that will protect our nation from an unwitting disaster. If you cannot vote right now, then speak up about the legalization of marijuana, and let as many people know as possible. You have more power than you think with your voice, just make sure you choose the correct choice.
